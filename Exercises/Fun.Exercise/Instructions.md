# Fun Exercise is Fun

Create a command-line driven program (e.g. a game) with the following requirements:

- Must have at least one class with at least one method, property and field
- Must have at least one collection
- Must use multiple (~3) language features we have discussed (in addition to above) (e.g. `for` or `while` loops, arethmatic operations, `static`, constructors, etc.). Extra credit if you implement inheritance/polymorphism
- Must use at least one `System` library (e.g. `System.Random`)
